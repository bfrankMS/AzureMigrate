# AzureMigrate

Powerpoint presentation link is [here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!Ah3kyMI0Hv0ij5M6GCy-_EIThTa0OQ?e=c43sUV)

## Goal ##  
This training is about a fast start to Azure Migrate. Based on a fictious company / setup we plan what needs to be done in order to migrate onpremise servers to Azure.  
This will include:  
- Which tools can be used.
- Network design - VNET - subnet segregation - NSGs - and a hybrid Site-2-Site VPN connection.
- Setup a domain controller in Azure and connect it to onprem as our workload needs auth'n for auth'z.
- Do an assessment of the existing infrastructure including its dependencies and cost.
- Perform the actual migration & do some troubleshooting!

After this day you will have an idea on how to start a migration project.
