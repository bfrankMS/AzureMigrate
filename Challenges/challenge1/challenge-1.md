**2 business applications** are run in that setup:

By the end of this challenge you should be able to answer the following **questions**:
- Which tool would you use to show the servers dependencies?
- How would you estimate the monthly Azure costs? 
- How can you leverage existing onpremises identities in the Azure Subscription (e.g. Ops groups)?
- How would you make sure that migrated applications need to be segmented at the network layer?
- How will Contoso Mortgage host its public DNS in Azure and manage DNS records for its migrated web applications?
